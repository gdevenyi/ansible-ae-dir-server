  <li id="name">
    <p class="faq_q">
      What's the official name of the project and why I see those strange characters?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      The official name is <strong>&AElig;-DIR</strong> to be
      distinguishable from any other project (and to challenge Unicode
      capabilities of software). <strong>AE-DIR</strong> is the official
      pure-ASCII representation. Only capital letters are used in both
      representations.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li id="complexity">
    <p class="faq_q">
      &AElig;-DIR seems complex.
      How to start with a simple setup for my very few systems?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      &AElig;-DIR is designed to scale down and up:<br>
      You can <a href="install.html">install</a> the system and start with
      one <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeZone">zone</a> and a single
      <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeSrvGroup">host/service group</a>
      for all your systems pointing to a single
      <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeGroup">user group</a>.
      Later you can extend that to your growing needs by adding more
      host/service and user groups and by moving hosts/services.
    </p>

<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

<ol>

  <li id="os">
    <p class="faq_q">
      Can &AElig;-DIR server run on <em>name-your-favourite-OS-here</em>?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      &AElig;-DIR is not limited to run on Linux. Provided you have
      packages of all the required software it could be installed on
      various OS platforms. But note that tweaking the automated
      <a href="install.html">ansible installation</a> to run on different
      platforms is much work.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li id="ldapserver">
    <p class="faq_q">
      Can I use another LDAP server software for &AElig;-DIR?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      No. &AElig;-DIR makes heavy use of
      <a href="docs.html#slapd.access">OpenLDAP's access control</a>.
      To best of my knowledge other LDAP server implementations do not
      provide similar powerful access control. If you have different
      opinion/suggestion please let me know.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li id="openldap">
    <p class="faq_q">
      I prefer to install only packages shipped by my Linux
      (enterprise) distribution.
      Why are OpenLDAP packages from different repositories installed?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      &AElig;-DIR has quite a complex
      <a href="docs.html#slapd.conf">OpenLDAP configuration</a>
      which requires to have recent bug fix releases
      (see also
      <a href="http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/1456.html"
         title="OpenLDAP Faq-O-Matic: Why is using the OpenLDAP server from a Linux distribution not recommended?">
         OpenLDAP FAQ-O-MATIC</a>).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li id="searchbase">
    <p class="faq_q">
      Can I use another search base than <em>ou=ae-dir</em>?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      Yes. You can set ansible variable <em>aedir_suffix</em> which is used
      in all ansible tasks. Note that currently this is not well tested.
      Please provide feedback if you're using it.

<h1 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h1>

<ol>

  <li id="backup">
    <p class="faq_q">
      How to backup the data?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      On each <a href="docs.html#sys-provider">&AElig;-DIR provider</a> a
      CRON job exports the databases to LDIF files with command-line tool
      <em>slapcat</em>.
      (see also
      <a href="http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/maintenance.html"
         title="OpenLDAP Software 2.4 Administrator's Guide: Maintenance">
         OpenLDAP Admin Guide</a>).
      How often this happens and where the files are stored can be
      configured with ansible vars.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li id="api">
    <p class="faq_q">
      Is there an API for bulk operations?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      The official API for programming &AElig;-DIR is LDAPv3
      (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4510">see RFC 4510</a>).
      Access control and constraints in
      <a href="docs.html#slapd.conf">OpenLDAP configuration</a>
      prevents your client <a href="docs.html#roles">role</a> to
      access/alter entries in an invalid way.
      <br>
      One read-to-use module is available for
      <a href="python.html">Python</a>.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li id="delete">
    <p class="faq_q">
      I always get an error message <em>insufficientAccess</em> when I try
      to delete a user or a group. What's wrong?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      Nothing's wrong. It works as designed.<br>
      User names, group names and numeric POSIX Id must never be reused.
      This is enforced by unique constraints and therefore deletion of user
      and group entries is prevented by ACLs. Set the status to
      &quot;archived&quot; (2) to make the entries invisible even for the
      zone admins.

  <li id="netgroup">
    <p class="faq_q">
      Is the <em>netgroup</em> map supported by &AElig;-DIR?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      Short answer: No!<br>
      Long answer:<br>
      &AElig;-DIR is designed to replace netgroups completely by leveraging
      <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeSrvGroup">host/service groups</a>
      referencing
      <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeGroup">user groups</a>
      as login groups (via attribute <em>aeLoginGroups</em>).
    </p>
  </li>

  <li id="nested_groups">
    <p class="faq_q">
      Are nested groups supported by &AElig;-DIR?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      No, because of bad performance. Furthermore you will loose
      oversight over nested groups sooner or later.
      Try understanding/leveraging the power
      <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeSrvGroup">host/service groups</a>
      referencing
      <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeGroup">user groups</a>
      which serves the same purpose in most practical cases.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li id="user_rights">
    <p class="faq_q">
      I'm too lazy to add groups etc.
      Can I directly assign rights to a user account?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      No! You always must add
      <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeSrvGroup">host/service groups</a>
      and assign the rights to them to
      <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeGroup">user groups</a>.
      Think about it a few minutes. It makes sense!
