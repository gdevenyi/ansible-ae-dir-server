  <li id="complexity">
    <p class="faq_q">
      &AElig;-DIR seems complex.
      How to start with a simple setup for my very few systems?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      &AElig;-DIR is designed to scale down and up:<br>
      You can <a href="install.html">install</a> the system and start with 
      one <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeZone">zone</a> and a single
      <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeSrvGroup">host/service group</a>
      for all your systems pointing to a single
      <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeGroup">user group</a>.
      Later you can extend that to your growing needs by adding more 
      host/service and user groups and by moving hosts/services.

  <li id="netgroup">
    <p class="faq_q">
      Is the <em>netgroup</em> map supported by &AElig;-DIR?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      Short answer: No!<br>
      Long answer:<br>
      &AElig;-DIR is designed to replace netgroups completely by leveraging
      <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeSrvGroup">host/service groups</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="user_rights">
    <p class="faq_q">
      I'm too lazy to add groups etc.
      Can I directly assign rights to a user account?
    </p>
    <p class="faq_a">
      No! You always must add
      <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeSrvGroup">host/service groups</a>
      and assign the rights to them to
      <a href="docs.html#schema-oc-aeGroup">user groups</a>.
      Think about it a few minutes. It makes sense!
