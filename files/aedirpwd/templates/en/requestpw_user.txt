Dear user,

a password reset for your user entry was requested.

If you did that yourself you should immediately set a new password by
entering the following link in your web browser. This is possible only
for a couple of minutes.

https://%(web_ctx_host)s%(app_path_prefix)s/resetpw?username=%(username)s&temppassword1=%(temppassword1)s

You will need a separate reset password.
This will be given to you by one of your zone admins:

%(admin_email_addrs)s

If you react too late to this e-mail and above link does not work you can
simply request the password reset again with this link:

https://%(web_ctx_host)s%(app_path_prefix)s/requestpw?username=%(username)s

If someone else falsely invoked the password request you can simply
ignore this message or inform the administrator reachable through
%(fromaddr)s.

Have fun!

Your LDAP admins.
