Dear %(user_cn)s,

the password of your Æ-DIR personal account will expire soon and you
have to change it as soon as possible. Better now than too late!

After password expiration you will not be able to change the
password yourself without help of a zone admin!

Password change form:

https://%(web_ctx_host)s%(app_path_prefix)s/changepw?username=%(user_uid)s

If it's already too late you have to follow the instructions in section
"Password reset" below.

--------------------------- Account details ----------------------------

User name: %(user_uid)s

Full display name:
%(user_displayname)s

Description in user entry:
%(user_description)s

Distinguished name of user entry:
%(user_dn)s

Created/activated by:
%(admin_cn)s <%(admin_mail)s>

-------------------------- Password reset ------------------------------

You can request a temporary password for your account here:

https://{web_ctx_host}{app_path_prefix}/requestpw?username={user_uid}

Note: You will need the zone admin to provide a separate reset password.

You can find detailed documentation about password reset process in
the user guide:

https://{web_ctx_host}/pwd.html#reset-procedure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have fun!

Your Æ admins.
