Dear %(user_cn)s,

the password of your Æ-DIR personal account will expire soon and you 
have to change it as soon as possible here:

https://%(web_ctx_host)s%(app_path_prefix)s/changepw?username=%(user_uid)s

After password expiration you will not be able to change the 
password yourself without admin interaction!

If it's already too late you have to follow the instructions in section
"Password reset".

--------------------------- Account details ----------------------------

User name: %(user_uid)s

Full display name:
%(user_displayname)s

Description in user entry:
%(user_description)s

Distinguished name of user entry:
%(user_dn)s

Created/activated by:
%(admin_cn)s <%(admin_mail)s>

-------------------------- Password reset ------------------------------

You can find detailed documentation about password reset process here:

https://%(web_ctx_host)s/pwd.html#reset-procedure

Please contact these zone admin(s) now (e.g. by phone) and ask him/her 
to assist you:

%(admin_cn)s <%(admin_mail)s>

After contacting the zone admin you can request a temporary password
for your account here:

https://%(web_ctx_host)s%(app_path_prefix)s/requestpw?username=%(user_uid)s

1. The 1st part of the temporary password will be sent to you by
   e-mail (simply click on the link in the e-mail).

2. The zone admin will tell you the 2nd part of the temporary 
   password you will have to enter in the form for (re-)setting your 
   personal password.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have fun!

Your Æ admins.
